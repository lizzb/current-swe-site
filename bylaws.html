				<b>Section 4 - Vacancy of the Office</b><br><br>
				A vacancy in the office of President is filled by the Vice-President. <br>
				A vacancy in the office of another officer is filled by an election. <br><br>
				<b>Section 5 - Inability to meet all of duties</b><br><br>
				If for some reason an officer becomes incapable to serve out some of the 
				responsibilities, it is this officer's responsibility to find a comparable 
				replacement in a timely manner. This replacement must be approved in some 
				form by the current executive board either through informal elections or 
				group discussion. <br><br>
				Furthermore, if a candidate will be away from campus during any significant 
				part of their term, they may only be elected if they choose to run for office 
				as a co-chair and the second candidate is able to fill the position during 
				the period when the first candidate will be absent. If both candidates are 
				present during one or more quarters of their co-chair term, they must decide 
				between the following two options:<br><br>
				<li class="swelist">Both candidates attend all executive board meetings and are equally involved in executive board duties.</li>
				<li class="swelist">One candidate attends all executive board meetings and the second candidate has lesser responsibilities.</li><br>
				<b>Section 6 – Impeachment</b><br><br>
				An officer may proceed in impeaching another officer on the board by taking the following measures.<br><br>
				<li class="swelist">Approach the President stating intent to draft a letter of impeachment against another officer (if President is the one to be impeached, approach Internal Vice President with this intention). </li>
				<li class="swelist">If the President (or Internal Vice President) has not done so previously, they must meet with the individual to be impeached regarding the concerns that brought on the impeachment. The President (or Internal Vice President) may choose to have this meeting conducted by or with the section’s SWE Counselor.</li><br> 
				After 2 weeks time, if no progress has been made through the aforementioned meeting the following steps must be taken: <br><br>
				<li class="swelist">An officer must draft a letter stating concrete reasons for the impeachment of another officer. </li>
				<li class="swelist">This letter must be agreed upon (via signatures) by at least 2/3 of the executive board. </li>
				<li class="swelist">This letter must be given to the President (or Internal Vice President) and then the President (or Internal Vice President) will give the letter, sans signatures, to the officer who is being impeached. </li><br>
				Following this impeachment process, elections will be held to fill the vacant position. 
				The impeached officer cannot be a candidate in these elections. <br><br>
				If there is a conflict with approaching the President or Internal Vice President with impeachment concerns, one may approach the SWE section counselor. The President, Internal Vice President and SWE section counselor are the only three people who may execute the final impeachment (Step 3).<br>
